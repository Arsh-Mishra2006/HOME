    <p>Welcome to HELLO</p></div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>At HELLO, we are passionate about addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time—food waste. Every year, millions of tons of food are wasted globally, leading to environmental damage, wasted resources, and missed opportunities to feed people in need. Our platform is dedicated to raising awareness, providing practical solutions, and encouraging community involvement to reduce food waste at every level.</p>

    <div id="title"><h2>Why Food Waste Matters</h2></div>
    <ul id="list">
        <li><b>Environmental Impact:</b> Wasted food contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, as food that ends up in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Reducing food waste can help mitigate climate change by cutting down these emissions.</li>
        <li><b>Resource Conservation:</b> When we waste food, we also waste the resources that went into producing it, including water, energy, land, and labor. For example, it takes approximately 1,800 gallons of water to produce just one pound of beef.</li>
        <li><b>Social Responsibility:</b> With nearly one billion people facing food insecurity globally, reducing food waste is also a step toward addressing hunger. The food that we save can help support food banks, shelters, and communities in need.</li>
    </ul>
